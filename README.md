MSE194 - Workflow and files 

This repository contains the iPython notebook with a linear thermoelasticity workflow analyzed with the finite element method using FEniCS. There are files corresponding to varying geometries such as curved triangles, bowties, and dots with different coordinates. 

Coordinates.py is the python script used to check for overlapping geometries. Modify the .geo files and Coordinates.py for different geometries. 

Require installation of FEniCS to run the code.
